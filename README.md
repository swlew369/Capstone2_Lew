# Capstone2_Lew
Machine Learning Classification of Proteins, Bioinformatics

SpringBoard Capstone Project

This project will classify proteins by function and cellular 
location. Using one-hot encoding method, a protein
sequence is converted into a Count Vector. Then,
Count Vectors associated with each protein are used
to train Machine Learning models that predict the function
and cellular location.

#Data Wrangling:#
The following links are for Jupyter Notebooks with the Python
code used to parse FASTA files for each function and location class
